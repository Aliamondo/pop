===[3 - USAGE]=================================================================

In order to use apoplexy, you need at least one file from the DOS version of either Prince of Persia 1 (PoP1) or Prince of Persia 2 (PoP2). Copy PoP1 (or just its "LEVELS.DAT" file) into the prince/ directory and/or copy PoP2 (or just its "PRINCE.DAT" file) into the prince2/ directory.

IMPORTANT: For PoP1, use a PRINCE.EXE that has all resources enabled in all levels. For example:

http://www.popot.org/get_the_games/software/PoP1.zip
http://www.popot.org/get_the_games/software/PoP2.zip

Optionally, you can recompile apoplexy: $ make
(You will need libsdl-image1.2-dev, libsdl-ttf2.0-dev and libsdl-gfx1.2-dev.)

Start apoplexy: $ ./apoplexy
(You will need libsdl-image1.2, libsdl-ttf2.0 and libsdl-gfx1.2.)
